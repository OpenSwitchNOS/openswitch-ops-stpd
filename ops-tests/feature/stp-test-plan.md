8:A	Bridge Identifier comprising of Priority and MAC Address components. In this examplePriority component was configured via CLI with the use of step 8, i.e. corresponds to the real value of  8*4096=32768. “A” is a MAC address of the Bridge. When MAC addresses of two different Bridges are being compared “A” means it is lower (better) than “B”, “B” is lower (better) than “C” and so on.

8:1	Port Identifier comprising of Priority and Port Number components. In this example Priority component was configured via CLI with the use of step 8, i.e. corresponds to the real value of  8*16=128. “1”is the number Bridge uses to identify a port, i.e. first port on the slot A.

MST Region A	MST Configuration Identifier information comprising of name, revision number and digest value a switch is using to advertise it to other switches in order to form MST Region.

#### Description
1. Start packet capturing.
2. You should not see any spanning tree packets coming out of the boxes.
3. On both switches enable protocol via CLI.
4. Check that packet analyzer is capturing spanning tree packets. Verify that initially both switches send packets with the default Hello Time interval. In about 2 Hello Time intervals “8:B” switch should stop sending packets while the **“8:A”** switch still continue send packets with the Hello Time interval.
5. Look at the captured packets both switches initially sent and verify both switches claim themselves as a root.
6. Disconnect and than reconnect link on the **“8:B”** switch.
7. Check that switch **“8:B”** starts sending packets again and than stops it in a few seconds. Look at the captured packets and verify switch claims itself to be a root.
8. Using CLI show commands verify that switch **“8:A”** is known as a CST root on both switches.

```
#### Configuration
On all switches, starting from default configuration as required by the corresponding topology, spanning tree status to “enabled” , no MSTIs configured.
#### Description
1. Starting from the Topology I example verify that initial active topology matches to that shown on the picture. On every switch in the topology the default MST Configuration name should be a text string using the hexadecimal representation of the switch’s MAC address, MST Configuration revision should be set “0” and digest value should be “0xAC36177F50283CD4B83821D8AB26DE62”.
2. Verify that after configuring identical values for the MST Configuration Identifier parameters (config-name, config-revision ) the switches join (form) common MST Region. Use the sequence shown in the topology examples I-IV.
3. Verify that each switch located within the MST Region leaves that region when switch’s MST Configuration Identifier parameters (config-name, config-revision ) changed to the values different from what other switches have, e.g. starting from switch “8:D” reconfiguration verify that topology IV gradually transforms to the topology I.
4. Repeat step 2 and verify that the topology transforms back to example IV.
5. Check that transitioning from one active topology to another occurs within “2xHello Time” period.

#### Configuration
On all switches, starting from default configuration as required by the corresponding topology, spanning tree status to “enabled” , no MSTIs configured.
#### Description
1. Starting from the topology example I verify that all switches stay in separate MST Regions and active topology matches to that shown on the picture. Each switch should be selected as the Root of its Region. One switch (“8:A”) should be selected as the CIST Root for all of them.
2. Modifying MST Configuration Identifier on the switches verify that topology I can transition to the topology II, then to the topology III and finally to the topology IV.
3. Modifying MST Configuration Identifier on the switches verify that active topology IV can transition back to the III, than to the II and finally to the initial example I.
4. Check that the convergence time for every expected topology change is within “2xHello Time” interval (“Hello Time” is the value configured on the CIST Root Bridge).

#### Configuration
On all switches, starting from default configuration as required by the corresponding topology, spanning tree status to “enabled” , no MSTIs configured.
#### Description
1. Configure and connect a switch ports as shown in topology example I. Verify that port roles and states match to that shown on the picture.
2. Configure ports and connect 2 switches as shown in topology example II. Verify that port roles and states match to that shown on the picture.
3. Configure ports and connect 2 switches as shown in topology example III. Verify that port roles and states match to that shown on the picture.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 when the switches have the same MST Configuration Identifier (i.e. are in the same MST Region). Resulting active topology should not change.
5. Configure switches and their ports as shown in topology examples IV-V. Verify that port roles and states match to that shown on the picture.
6. For every topology example try to reconnect links (disconnect/connect) and verify that topology converges within “2xHello Time” period to the stable state.
NOTE: On links that have assigned Alternate role to one of it ports the transitioning to the Forwarding state for the other (Designated) port may take up to “2*Forward Delay” time interval (30 seconds with default parameters).

#### Description
1. Configure and connect switches as shown in the topology example above.
2. Verify that switch “6:D” is known to be the CIST Root on all switches.
3. Verify that switch “6:D” is the Root of the MST Region One.
4. Verify that  switch “8:B” is known to be the IST Regional Root for the switches located within the MST Region Two.
5. Verify the operational values of Forward Delay, Max Age, Hello Time, Max Hops parameters on every switch. On each switch all parameters should be identical and equal to the default values configured on the switch “6D” (CIST Root).
6. On the switch “8:B” (MST Region Two Regional Root) change the configuration of Forward Delay, Max Age, Hello Time, Max Hops parameters to the values different from default.
7. Verify that on all switches the operational values of Forward Delay, Max Age, and Hello Time parameters remain unchanged and match to the values configured on the switch “6:D” (CIST Root).
8. Verify that Message Age parameter of the ‘CistRootTimes‘ held on the switches “8:B”, “8:A” and “7:C” is greater by one then on the switch “6:D” (CIST Root).
9. Verify that Remaining Hops parameter of the ‘CistRootTimes‘ held on the MST Region Two switches is as follows: on the switch “8:B” (IST Regional Root) it is equal to the new configured value, on the switch “8:A” it is less by one and on the switch “7:C” it is less by two then on the “8:B” switch.
10. Verify that active topology still matches to that shown in the above picture.
11. On the switch “8:B” (IST Regional Root) set Max Hops configuration parameter to the value of 1.
12. Verify that Remaining Hops parameter of the ‘CistRootTimes‘ held on the switch “8:A” is equal to 0.
13. Verify that switch “7:C” has the value of the Remaining Hops equal to default (20) and assumes that it is CST Root and IST Regional Root for the MST Region Two. This is an example of the MSTP parameters misconfiguration.

```
#### Configuration
On all switches, starting from default configuration as required by the corresponding topology, spanning tree status to “enabled”.
#### Description
Using topology example I connect 4 switches and create on every switch 3 MSTI entries, MSTI 1, MSTI 2 and MSTI 3.
2. Configure Bridge Priority value for each MSTI as shown in the topology example I.
3. Verify that within MST Region One the active topology built by each spanning tree instance (the IST and MSTIs) matches to what is shown in the topology I example, i.e. each instance has different Regional Root switch. For each spanning tree instance the active topology should converge within “2xHello Time” interval and remain stable for unlimited time.
4. Connect and configure 3 switches as shown in the topology example II.
5. Verify that the active topology built by the IST instance and each MSTI matches to the picture.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for MST Instances with different IDs, e.g. MSTI 5, MSTI 7, MSTI 16.

#### Configuration
On all switches, starting from default configuration as required by the corresponding topology, spanning tree status to “enabled”.
#### Description
1. Configure switches and connect the switches ports as shown in the topology example I. Verify that port roles and states match to that shown on the picture.
2. Start “ping” Host 1 <-> Host 2. Verify that on both hosts each ICMP Echo Request packet is echoed back via an ICMP Echo Response packet, i.e. connectivity between hosts is established.
3. Starting from port “8:1”, disconnect one by one links between switches “8:A”and “8:B”.
Verify that “ping” still succeeds and connectivity recovery time does not exceeds the 2 * Hello Time interval. Doing links disconnection check that all ports states and roles matches to what is expected.
4. One by one restore disconnected links back and verify that “ping” still succeeds and connectivity recovery time does not exceeds the 2 * Hello Time interval. Doing links disconnection check that all ports states and roles matches to what is expected.
6. Configure switches and connect the switches ports as shown in the topology example II. Verify that port roles and states match to that shown on the picture.
7. Start “ping” Host 1 <-> Host 2. Verify that on both hosts each ICMP Echo Request packet is echoed back via an ICMP Echo Response packet, i.e. connectivity between hosts is established.
8. Randomly break links between switches so that theoretically at least one path is always available between the hosts. Verify that “ping” still succeeds and connectivity recovery time does not exceeds the 2 * Hello Time interval. Doing links disconnection check that all ports states and roles matches to what is expected.
9. Restore initial topology example II. Verify that “ping” still succeeds and connectivity recovery time does not exceeds the 2 * Hello Time interval. Verify that port roles and states match to that shown on the picture.
10. Shutdown (power off) switch “8:B”. Verify that “ping” still succeeds and connectivity recovery time does not exceeds the 2 * Hello Time interval.
11. Bring up (power on) switch “8:B”. Verify that “ping” still succeeds and connectivity recovery time does not exceeds the 2 * Hello Time interval.
12. Repeat steps 10-11 with the switch “8:C”.

#### Configuration
On all switches, starting from default configuration, protocol version is set to “mstp”, protocol administrative status is “enabled”, participating ports are configured to be non-Edge, both switches are in the same region, few MSTIs are configured on both switches, path-cost for all participating ports is manually configured to 2000000 for the IST and MSTIs.
#### Description
1. Configure and connect switches as shown in the topology example.
2. Verify that resulting active topology match to that shown on the picture.
3. Start packets capture.
4. Disconnect port “8:3”of the switch “8:A” and wait >= 30seconds.
5. Stop packets capture.
6. In the capture buffer you should not see any BPDU with the ‘Topology Change’ bit set.
7. Start packets capture.
8. Connect port “8:3”of the switch “8:A” and wait for about 30 seconds to let the port  “8:2” become forwarding and initiate the switch “8:A”to start generate TCN messages on its port “8:1”.
9. Stop packets capture.
10. Look at the capture buffer; you should see BPDUs with the ‘Topology Change’ bit set propagated by the switch “8:B”over its port “8:1”. Verify that in BPDUs following the first transmitted TCN BPDU within 2 * Hello Time interval the ‘Topology Change’ bit is set in the ‘flags’ field in each MSTI Configuration Message carried in that BPDU.
NOTE: The particular TCN BPDU may not contain ‘Topology Change’ bit for every MSTI encoded in that BPDU. The important thing is that in all BPDUs transmitted after the first TCN BPDU within 2 x Hello Time interval the ‘Topology Change’ bit should be present for each MSTI at least one time.
11. Verify that TCN BPDUs are being propagated no longer than approximately twice of the Hello Time interval.
12. Start packets capture.
13. Reconnect port “8:1”of the switch “8:A” and wait ~10 seconds.
14. Stop packets capture.
15. Look at the capture buffer; you should see BPDUs with the ‘Topology Change’ bit set propagated by the switch “8:B”over its port “8:1”. Verify that in BPDUs following the first transmitted TCN BPDU within 2 x Hello Time interval the ‘Topology Change’ bit is set in the ‘flags’ field in each MSTI Configuration Message carried in that BPDU.
NOTE: The particular TCN BPDU may not contain ‘Topology Change’ bit for every MSTI encoded in that BPDU. The important thing is that in all BPDUs transmitted after the first TCN BPDU within 2 x Hello Time interval the ‘Topology Change’ bit should be present for each MSTI at least one time.
16. Verify that TCN messages are being propagated no longer than approximately twice of the Hello Time interval.
