Component design of ops-stpd
==============================

The ops-stpd daemon manages to avoid bridge loops (multiple paths linking one segment to another, resulting in an infinite loop situation).

Responsibilities
----------------
The ops-stpd daemon is responsible for managing all MSTP Instances defined by the user.

Relationships to external OpenSwitch entities
---------------------------------------------

```
The ops-stpd daemon monitors the MSTP related schema in the database. As the configuration and state information for the ports and interfaces are changed, ops-stpd examines the data to determine if there are new Instances being defined in the configuration and if state information for interfaces has changed. The ops-stpd daemon uses this information to configure MSTP Instances and update the MSTP protocol state machines.

The ops-stpd daemon registers for MSTP BPDUs on all L2-Ports configured for MSTP, and sends and receives BPDUs to the peer via the L2-Ports.

When the state information maintained by ops-stpd changes, it updates the information in the database. Some of this information is strictly status, but this also includes hardware configuration, which is used by ops-switchd to configure the switch.

Participating Modules
---------------------
The ops-stpd daemon has three operational threads:
* ovsdb_thread
  This thread processes the typical OVSDB main loop, and handles any changes. Some changes are handled by passing messages to the mstpd_protocol_thread thread.
* mstpd_protocol_thread
  This thread processes messages sent to it by the other two threads. Processing of the messages includes operating the finite state machines.
* mstp_rx_pdu_thread
  This thread waits for MSTP BPDUs on interfaces. When a MSTP BPDU is received, it sends a message (including the packet data) to the mstpd_protocol_thread thread for processing through the state machines.

OVSDB Thread Functioning
------------------------
This thread keeps listening on the tables and columns which MSTP is interested in (listed above).
Updates its local cache, and trigger an event to Protocol thread if there is any change in Config parameters of schema.

Protocol Thread Functioning
---------------------------
The ops-stpd daemon handles multiple events received from OVSDB updates.
* L2-Port Add:
  When a L2-Port is created in OVSDB, daemon will creata a entry for CIST_port and MSTI_port if exists. Updates the daemon data structures and if MSTP is enabled it triggers the state machines which are relevant. Split/LAG ports does not have any special functionality from ops-stpd perspective.
  Splitting a L2-Port will result in L2-Port Delete and L2-Port Add.
  Creating a LAG will also result in L2-Port Delete and L2-Port Add.
* L2-Port Delete:
  When a L2-Port is being removed in OVSDB, daemon will remove the respective CIST and MSTI port entries. Clears the daemon data structures for the ports being deleted. Split/LAG ports does not have any special functionality from ops-stpd perspective.
  Unsplitting a L2-Port will result in L2-Port Deletes and L2-Port Add.
  Deleting a LAG will result in deletion of L2-Port Delete and L2-Port Adds.
  Modifying a LAG will result in deletion of L2-Port Delete.
* VLAN Add:
  When a VLAN is being added in OVSDB, daemon will map newly added VLAN into CIST by default. In Daemon restart scenario, daemon will check if the VLAN is already mapped in CIST/MSTI and the add into CIST or ignore if present.
* VLAN Delete:
  When a VLAN is being deleted in OVSDB, daemon will unmap the VLANS from CIST/MSTI wherever it is mapped. When the last VLAN is being deleted from Instance, Instance should be deleted from the daemon.
* Packet Receive:
  The ops-stpd daemon process the MSTP BPDUs from the Peers, and compares with the config related parameters in the DB.

RX PDU Thread Functioning
---------------------------
This thread keeps listening on the sockets using epoll mechanism.
Whenever a packet is received from any of the sockets, this sends the packet to the MSTP Protocol thread for processing.


Switchd MSTP Feature Plugin
---------------------------
Daemon calculates the priority vectors and takes a decision on the ports which has to be forwarded and blocked.
ops-stpd also updates DB on the state changes/statistics/status parameters in interfaces based on priority vectors.

Once daemon sets port state as Forwarding/Blocking/Learning, switchd plugin shall take care of setting the values into the ASIC.
